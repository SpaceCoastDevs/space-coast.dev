## About Us

Space Coast Devs (formerly Space Coast Tech Club) is a place for developers, designers, scientists, IT professionals, and technologists to learn and share knowledge about technology. We host meetups and other events to facilitate community members to connect with one another. We also have a Discord server where the community can chat and ask questions. We welcome people of all skill levels and backgrounds.

If you are in the Space Coast area, we would love to have you join us!
