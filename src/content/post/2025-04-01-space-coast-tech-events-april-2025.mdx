# Space Coast Tech Meetups

- [Open House: 3D Printing, Thu, Apr 3, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/306728804/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  FREE and open to the public of all ages! This is the time to come and learn how to use the 3D printer; as well as how to obtain or create files to run on them. The 3D printer has a nominal charge of 5 cents per gram for the filament it consumes; but larger projects you may want to obtain 3D filament of your own. Generally, 1 Kgram of 1.75 mm PLA filament is the most common used by many of our members.

- [Open House: Laser Cutting, Thu, Apr 3, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/306729588/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  Want to learn how to use a laser cutter? Have something you need engraved or laser cut? Need to figure out your new tabletop, laser engraver? Check out our open house! It's free and open to the public of all ages!

  We use a 100-watt CO2 laser cutter with a Ruida 644XG controller. (More information can be found
  [here](https://wiki.melbournemakerspace.org/Laser%20Cutter)
  .) It can cut paper, fabric, and up to 1/4" in wood or laser-safe acrylic. There is some scrap material available for use free of charge, but if you have a bigger project, you will need to bring in material to use.

  We use Lightburn software to control the laser. It can read most of the standard graphic and vector file types including .bmp, .jpg, .ai, .dxf, and .svg.

- [Open House: Electronics Projects and Programming, Sat, Apr 5, 2025, 10:00 AM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/306752639/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  Want to learn basic electronics? Interested in working with a microcontroller, like the arduino, ESP32, or the Raspberry Pi Pico? Need help designing your own PCB? Want to learn to program in Python? Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.

  The open house is generally unstructured. It has been more effective to work with people 1 on 1. That way people can start, and continue, learning at their own pace.

- [Wood Shop, Mon, Apr 7, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/306798098/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  Free and open to the public! This is the time to come and learn woodworking, power tools like the band saw, table saw, drill press, sanders, etc. We even have a CNC! Want to fix a broken table leg? Build a shelf? Build a bird or bat house? Work on these projects and anything you imagine every week!

  Drop in a take a tour of the Makerspace to see what it's all about.
