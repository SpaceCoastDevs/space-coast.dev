## [Open House: Wood Turning, Sat, Jan 3, 2026, 10:00 AM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/312432146/) via [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

Learn to Turn! Someone will show you how to turn wood safely on a lathe & which tools you should use. You can turn spindles, pens, bowls, or a wide variety of other items. Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.  
The open house is generally unstructured. It has been more effective to work with people 1 on 1. That way people can start, and continue, learning at their own pace.

Want to learn basic electronics? Interested in working with a microcontroller, like the arduino, ESP32, or the Raspberry Pi Pico? Need help designing your own PCB? Want to learn to program in Python? Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.
