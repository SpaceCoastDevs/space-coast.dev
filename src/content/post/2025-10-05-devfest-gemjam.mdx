**DevFest GemJam** is a welcoming space where people of all backgrounds come together to imagine, build, and share ideas for a better future. Instead of focusing on competition or speed, we emphasize collaboration, creativity, and community impact. With AI transforming the world, we approach it as a tool for augmentation, not replacement -- a partner that supports human creativity, connection, and problem-solving.

This is your unparalleled opportunity to dive deep into the thrilling realm of **AI agents** and discover how they seamlessly integrate with the cutting-edge power of Google's **web, mobile, and cloud technologies**. Whether you're an AI pioneer or eager to explore new frontiers, GenJam is your launchpad!

This event will offer three tracks:

- **Software prototype:** Make a working MVP of a high impact software app or game enabled by AI
- **App pitch:** Participants can pitch a design and concept of operations for an app
- **Company pitch:** Your team of Product Managers are tasked with creating a business plan + product definition for Event Horizon Labs. Imagine a strong business concept that leverages AI that surpasses human intelligence.
