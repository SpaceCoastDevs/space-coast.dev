## [Open House: 3D Printing, Thu, Sep 4, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/310543335/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

FREE and open to the public of all ages! This is the time to come and learn how to use the 3D printer; as well as how to obtain or create files to run on them. The 3D printer has a nominal charge of 5 cents per gram for the filament it consumes; but larger projects you may want to obtain 3D filament of your own. Generally, 1 Kgram of 1.75 mm PLA filament is the most common used by many of our members.

- **Date:** Sep 4
- **Time:** 7:00 PM
- **Group:** [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

## [Open House: Laser Cutting, Thu, Sep 4, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/310544281/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

Want to learn how to use a laser cutter? Have something you need engraved or laser cut? Need to figure out your new tabletop, laser engraver? Check out our open house! It's free and open to the public of all ages!

We use a 100-watt CO2 laser cutter with a Ruida 644XG controller. (More information can be found [here](https://wiki.melbournemakerspace.org/Laser%20Cutter).) It can cut paper, fabric, and up to 1/4" in wood or laser-safe acrylic. There is some scrap material available for use free of charge, but if you have a bigger project, you will need to bring in material to use.

We use Lightburn software to control the laser. It can read most of the standard graphic and vector file types including .bmp, .jpg, .ai, .dxf, and .svg.

- **Date:** Sep 4
- **Time:** 7:00 PM
- **Group:** [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

## [Open House: Wood Turning, Sat, Sep 6, 2025, 10:00 AM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/310320597/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

Learn to Turn! Someone will show you how to turn wood safely on a lathe & which tools you should use. You can turn spindles, pens, bowls, or a wide variety of other items. Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.  
The open house is generally unstructured. It has been more effective to work with people 1 on 1. That way people can start, and continue, learning at their own pace.

## [SpaceCoastSec - Crack the Locks, Wed, Sep 10, 2025, 6:30 PM](https://www.meetup.com/spacecoastsec/events/309726384/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [SpaceCoastSec - Space Coast's Information Security Community](https://www.meetup.com/spacecoastsec)

Join SpaceCoastSec at 6:30PM EST for an in-person gathering of local cybersecurity professionals, enthusiasts, and curious learners. Each meetup features a speaker discussing a timely infosec topic, as well as open discussion time before and after the presentation for casual banter and friendly networking. Our sessions are informal, inclusive, and completely free—no matter your experience level or background. Come learn, share ideas, ask questions, and stay updated on the latest trends in cybersecurity as part of Brevard County’s growing information security community.

Our monthly in-person meetups are held on the 2nd floor of Building 3 on the EFSC Palm Bay campus unless otherwise stated here on Meetup.

This month's presentation will be on locksport. Locksport is the hobby or sport of learning to open locks without the original key, often through techniques like lock picking. It encompasses the study of lock mechanisms and the ethical practice of defeating them, often involving competitive events and a community of enthusiasts.
