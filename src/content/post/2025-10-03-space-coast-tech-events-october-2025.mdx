## [Open House: Laser Cutting, Thu, Oct 2, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/311014150/?eventOrigin=group_past_events) via [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

Want to learn how to use a laser cutter? Have something you need engraved or laser cut? Need to figure out your new tabletop, laser engraver? Check out our open house! It's free and open to the public of all ages!

We use a 100-watt CO2 laser cutter with a Ruida 644XG controller. (More information can be found [here](https://wiki.melbournemakerspace.org/Laser%20Cutter).) It can cut paper, fabric, and up to 1/4" in wood or laser-safe acrylic. There is some scrap material available for use free of charge, but if you have a bigger project, you will need to bring in material to use.

We use Lightburn software to control the laser. It can read most of the standard graphic and vector file types including .bmp, .jpg, .ai, .dxf, and .svg.

- **Date:** Oct 2
- **Time:** 7:00 PM
- **Group:** [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)


## [Open House: 3D Printing, Thu, Oct 2, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/311013210/?eventOrigin=group_past_events) via [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

FREE and open to the public of all ages! This is the time to come and learn how to use the 3D printer; as well as how to obtain or create files to run on them. The 3D printer has a nominal charge of 5 cents per gram for the filament it consumes; but larger projects you may want to obtain 3D filament of your own. Generally, 1 Kgram of 1.75 mm PLA filament is the most common used by many of our members.

## [Open House: Wood Turning, Sat, Oct 4, 2025, 10:00 AM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/310727521/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [Melbourne Makerspace (Florida USA)](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/)

Learn to Turn! Someone will show you how to turn wood safely on a lathe & which tools you should use. You can turn spindles, pens, bowls, or a wide variety of other items. Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.  
The open house is generally unstructured. It has been more effective to work with people 1 on 1. That way people can start, and continue, learning at their own pace.

Want to learn basic electronics? Interested in working with a microcontroller, like the arduino, ESP32, or the Raspberry Pi Pico? Need help designing your own PCB? Want to learn to program in Python? Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.

Saturday, October 25th - join us for a mad dash to prototype in this new event series. Teams (formed at the event) will choose a prompt from real, local startups to solve and build for.

Prototypes can be sketches, software, or design and will be presented to our panel of judges at the end of the day - with a winner chosen and awarded with a unique badge.

This event is casual and intended to be an opportunity for tech and startup enthusiasts to stretch their rapid prototyping muscles and participate in a pseudo-sprint solving real problems. No specific experience necessary, but join ready to build and fail and build again!
