- [Open House: Electronics Projects and Programming, Sat, Jan 4, 2025, 10:00 AM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/305096386/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  Want to learn basic electronics? Interested in working with a microcontroller, like the arduino, ESP32, or the Raspberry Pi Pico? Need help designing your own PCB? Want to learn to program in Python? Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.
  
  The open house is generally unstructured. It has been more effective to work with people 1 on 1. That way people can start, and continue, learning at their own pace.

- [Computers & Programming, Tue, Jan 7, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/305156006/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  Let's get together and talk about everything computer hardware, programming languages, and operating systems!
  
  There is so much technology around us. It's awesome but often overwhelming. There is no particular topic - It's anything the group wants to discuss.

  Want to try installing Mint Linux?
  Build a web app using Vue?
  Install a new hard drive to make your pc faster?
  Need to learn how databases work?
  etc. etc. etc.

  Hosted by Tony Bellomo who serves as the Technical Director of Innovation at a global consulting company.

  No computer topic too small or too big - Let's share our knowledge and learn from each other.

  Any age, any knowledge level
