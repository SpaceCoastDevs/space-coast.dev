- [Computers & Programming, Tue, Dec 3, 2024, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/304552080/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  Let's get together and talk about everything computer hardware, programming languages, and operating systems!

  There is so much technology around us. It's awesome but often overwhelming. There is no particular topic - It's anything the group wants to discuss.

  Want to try installing Mint Linux?
  Build a web app using Vue?
  Install a new hard drive to make your pc faster?
  Need to learn how databases work?
  etc. etc. etc.

  Hosted by Tony Bellomo who serves as the Technical Director of Innovation at a global consulting company.

  No computer topic too small or too big - Let's share our knowledge and learn from each other.

  Any age, any knowledge level

- [Open House: 3D Printing, Thu, Dec 5, 2024, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/304588791/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  FREE and open to the public of all ages! This is the time to come and learn how to use the 3D printer; as well as how to obtain or create files to run on them. The 3D printer has a nominal charge of 5 cents per gram for the filament it consumes; but larger projects you may want to obtain 3D filament of your own. Generally, 1 Kgram of 1.75 mm PLA filament is the most common used by many of our members.
