  FREE and open to the public of all ages! This is the time to come and learn how to use the 3D printer; as well as how to obtain or create files to run on them. The 3D printer has a nominal charge of 5 cents per gram for the filament it consumes; but larger projects you may want to obtain 3D filament of your own. Generally, 1 Kgram of 1.75 mm PLA filament is the most common used by many of our members.
