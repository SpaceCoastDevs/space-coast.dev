# Space Coast Tech Meetups

- [Open House: Electronics Projects and Programming, Sat, May 3, 2025, 10:00 AM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/306776124/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  Want to learn basic electronics? Interested in working with a microcontroller, like the arduino, ESP32, or the Raspberry Pi Pico? Need help designing your own PCB? Want to learn to program in Python? Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.

  The open house is generally unstructured. It has been more effective to work with people 1 on 1. That way people can start, and continue, learning at their own pace.

Come learn, share ideas, ask questions, and stay updated on the latest trends in cybersecurity as part of Brevard County’s growing information security community.
