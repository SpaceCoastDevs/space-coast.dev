The Space Coast Tech Club is now Space Coast Devs! I started the Space Coast Tech Club in 2018 as a way to connect with other tech enthusiasts in the area. The club was a success at the time, but things changed when COVID-19 hit. The club went dormant for a while, the Meetup API had changed, the local tech scene had changed, and I think the name had to change too. I decided to reboot the club as Space Coast Devs. The new name reflects the focus on developers and the broader tech community in the area. I'm excited to see where this new chapter takes us!
