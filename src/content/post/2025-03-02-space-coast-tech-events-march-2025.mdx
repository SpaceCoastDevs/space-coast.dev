# Space Coast Tech Meetups

- [Open House: 3D Printing, Thu, Mar 6, 2025, 7:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/events/306179820/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events) via [melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-makerspace-florida-usa/?eventOrigin=event_home_page)

  FREE and open to the public of all ages! This is the time to come and learn how to use the 3D printer; as well as how to obtain or create files to run on them. The 3D printer has a nominal charge of 5 cents per gram for the filament it consumes; but larger projects you may want to obtain 3D filament of your own. Generally, 1 Kgram of 1.75 mm PLA filament is the most common used by many of our members.

  Join SpaceCoastSec at 6:30PM EST for an in-person gathering of local cybersecurity professionals, enthusiasts, and curious learners. Each meetup features a speaker discussing a timely infosec topic, as well as open discussion time before and after the presentation for casual banter and friendly networking. Our sessions are informal, inclusive, and completely free—no matter your experience level or background. Come learn, share ideas, ask questions, and stay updated on the latest trends in cybersecurity as part of Brevard County’s growing information security community.

  Our monthly in-person meetups are held on the 2nd floor of Building 3 on the EFSC Palm Bay campus unless otherwise stated here on Meetup.
